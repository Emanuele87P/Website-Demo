    Python is a programming language for app and web development. Python code is easy to read and <br>
    translate and ca be used in various projects. Python is indicated in modern software development, <br>
    infrastructure management and date analysis. The python program is easy to read and is easier to <br>
    write a python program than Perl and Java.

    It was developed by the Dutch Guido van Rossum in the 1990s to improve the Perl <br>
    language. It had a quick success reaching the notoriety of other web languages such as <br>
    Java and Perl itself. He was given this name because Guido van Rossun likes an English <br>
    comedy group Monty Python.<br>
    P.S.<br>
    Then we complain that Java's name comes from a cafe.

    Unlike other programs, Python has variables that are not typed and the use of indentation for the syntax <br>
    of the specifications that does not use the common brackets. Among the other features of Python we <br>
    have the Overloarding of operators and functions through delegates, it is rich in type, basic functions <br>
    and standard libraries.

    Python, compared to other programs, commands are written on a single line and does not require <br>
    special termination characters (such as in Java and C++ we use the (;) to terminate the command), to <br>
    write more commands on the same line they can be divided using the (;). If we want to identify <br>
    variables, functions, classes and modules we initialize them with a letter or a (_). For Python it is a case <br>
    sensitive programming language, that is, uppercase and lowercase characters are considered two <br>
    different variables (for example Name and Name are different).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class names begin with an uppercase letter, all other identifiers begin with a lowercase letter;</li>
    <li>An identifier starting with an underscore indicates that it is a private identifier;</li>
    <li>An identifier starting with two underscores indicates that it is a strongly private identifier;</li>
    <li>If the identifier begins and ends with two underscores then it is a special name defined in the language.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As we can see between the two programs the differences are few:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To initialize a function in C++ we use for example “<b>int</b>” instead in Python we use the “def”;</li>
    <li>In Python we do not use curly brackets but the "<b>:</b>" and the rounds are not necessarily usable.<br>
      In order for the program to accept that the command is written on several lines, it is necessary to use the "<b>\</b>" except in cases where parentheses are used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To comment in Python:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comments should first be written on the same level of identification as the code you are <br>
      commenting on and it is best to avoid comments on the same line of code.</li>
    <li>You can use “<b>#</b>” to comment on the same line or the (“ <b>"</b> ”) to comment on multiple lines.</li>
  </ul>

    def = it is used to initialize a function; <br>
    if and else = it is used to make checks where in if we put the condition that we must verify is true or false and the else is used in the event that the condition in the if is false;<br>
    Return = it is used to return the final value or to forcibly interrupt it;<br>
    print = is for printing.
