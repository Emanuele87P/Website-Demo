  <p>
    Scratch is a programming language that allows you to create animations and games using block code. <br>
    Scratch is used by users of all ages. <br>
    With scratch people create projects in house, school beacuse it is free. <br>
    Scratch designs are simple are simple to use, <br>
    children and adults can use it. <br>
    The disadvantage is that its visual interface is different from other computer programs that are <br>
    created with a text-based system. Scratch does not teach coding languages.

  <font size="5" color="#0d4f4a"><b>History</b></font>
  <p>
    Scratch was created by MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten group and consulting firm, Playful <br>
    Invention Company, in 2003. <br>
    Scratch's name comes from the technique used by DJs. This name, of <br>
    course, is by no means accidental and accurately describes the basic idea of Scratch, namely that of <br>
    combining images, <br>
    sounds and texts together to create multimedia content.

  <font size="5" color="#0d4f4a"><b>Charateristics</b></font>
  <p>
    Scratch as we said before uses a block code, <br>
    its main screen is divided into 4 distinct areas and we have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The stage is the large white rectangle that is placed in the upper left corner and will be the "stage";</li>
    <br>
    <li>The Sprite (the characters) is a smaller window located below the stage;</li>
    <br>
    <li>The Block List is located in the center of the screen and is a column that contains all the programming <br>
      <br>
      blocks. Each type of block has a specific function and its own color, all this to distinguish it;
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>The Script Area is the area where we insert the blocks to create the scripts.</li>
  </ul>
  <font size="5" color="#0d4f4a"><b>Example of a simple program in Scrach</b></font><br>

  <ol>
    <li>When the green flag is clicked our sprit will move 10 meters forward after 5 seconds;</li>
    <br>
    <li>When we click on the down arrow the sprit will lean forward 15 degrees and emit a meow;</li>
    <br>
    <li>When we press the arrow pointing upwards, the sprit will straighten by 15 Â°.</li>
  </ol>
